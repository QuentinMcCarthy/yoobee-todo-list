// Pseudocode
// Initialise an object with all the relevant variables and methods
// Some variables and methods the object will contain are:
// An empty array
// A write method which will toggle between allowing users to write in the input
// And sending the input data into the array
// A delete method
// Which will remove the item from the DOM and array
// A tick method
// Which will toggle the tick icon between tick and unticked
// Inside a document ready will be three click events
// One for the writeButton id that fires the write method in the object
// One for the delButton id that fires the delete method in the object
// One for the tickBox class that fires the tick method in the object
